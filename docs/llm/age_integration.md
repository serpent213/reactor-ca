# Age-Based Public Key Encryption Options for Go File Encryption Applications

Your Go program working with PKCS#8 private keys for file encryption has several excellent options for integrating age-like public key encryption. The age ecosystem provides robust support for both native age keys and existing SSH infrastructure, making it an ideal choice for modernizing your encryption approach while maintaining compatibility with existing key management systems.

## Understanding Age Encryption

Age (pronounced with a hard 'g') is a simple, modern, and secure file encryption tool and library that addresses many of the shortcomings of older encryption tools like PGP/GPG[1][2]. It features small explicit keys, no configuration options, and UNIX-style composability, making it particularly well-suited for integration into existing applications[2].

The age format specification is available at age-encryption.org/v1 and provides strong cryptographic guarantees with a clean, minimal design[1]. Unlike traditional encryption tools, age focuses on doing one thing well: encrypting files to recipients who can decrypt them with their corresponding identities[3].

## Available Options for Your Go Application

Based on your existing infrastructure with PKCS#8 private keys and password-based encryption, you have several integration pathways:

### Native Age X25519 Keys

The most straightforward approach involves generating new X25519 key pairs using age's native cryptography[1]. This option provides the cleanest integration and highest security guarantees:

```go
import "filippo.io/age/age"

// Generate a new identity
identity, err := age.GenerateX25519Identity()
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Get the corresponding recipient (public key)
recipient := identity.Recipient()

// Use for encryption
w, err := age.Encrypt(dst, recipient)
```

This approach offers 128-bit security level, which meets NIST Category 1 post-quantum requirements and provides excellent future-proofing[4]. The keys are small (around 62 characters for public keys) and easily manageable[5].

### SSH Key Integration

For organizations with existing SSH infrastructure, age provides seamless compatibility through the `filippo.io/age/agessh` package[6]. This integration supports both Ed25519 and RSA SSH keys, allowing you to leverage existing key management systems:

#### Ed25519 SSH Keys

Ed25519 keys provide the best security and performance characteristics[6]:

```go
import "filippo.io/age/agessh"

// Parse SSH Ed25519 private key
identity, err := agessh.ParseIdentity(pemBytes)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Use for decryption
r, err := age.Decrypt(src, identity)
```

#### RSA SSH Keys

For legacy compatibility, RSA keys (minimum 2048 bits) are also supported[6]:

```go
// Create RSA identity from SSH key
rsaIdentity, err := agessh.NewRSAIdentity(privateKey)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Password-Based Encryption

Age also supports scrypt-based password encryption, which can serve as a bridge between your current PKCS#8 password-based system and public key encryption[1]:

```go
// Create scrypt-based recipient
recipient, err := age.NewScryptRecipient(password)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Encrypt to password
w, err := age.Encrypt(dst, recipient)
```

### Encrypted SSH Keys

For maximum security, age supports encrypted SSH private keys through the `EncryptedSSHIdentity` type[6]. This approach combines the convenience of SSH key reuse with additional passphrase protection:

```go
// Handle encrypted SSH keys
encIdentity, err := agessh.NewEncryptedSSHIdentity(
    pubKey, 
    pemBytes, 
    passphraseCallback,
)
```

## Integration Strategies

| Option | Key Source | Complexity | SSH Compatibility | Best For |
|--------|------------|------------|------------------|----------|
| Native X25519 | New keys | Simple | No | New applications |
| SSH Ed25519 | Reuse SSH keys | Medium | Yes | Existing SSH infrastructure |
| SSH RSA | Legacy SSH keys | Medium | Yes | Legacy compatibility |
| Passphrase | Password-based | Simple | No | Simple migration |
| Encrypted SSH | SSH + passphrase | High | Yes | Maximum security |

## Implementation Considerations

### Security Implications

Age provides strong cryptographic guarantees but with some important considerations[7]. Unlike some traditional encryption tools, age does not provide authentication by default - it only ensures confidentiality[7]. If you need authenticated encryption, you'll need to implement additional measures such as signing with separate tools like minisign[7].

The 128-bit security level provided by age's native X25519 implementation is considered appropriate for current and near-future threats[4]. However, some security-conscious applications may prefer 256-bit keys, though this is generally unnecessary for most use cases[4].

### PKCS#8 Compatibility Challenges

One important limitation is that age's SSH key support has some compatibility issues with PKCS#8 formatted keys[8]. The Go SSH library used by age has historically had problems with PKCS#8 encoded Ed25519 keys, particularly those generated by tools like 1Password[8]. However, these issues are being addressed in newer versions of the age library.

If you're currently using PKCS#8 keys and need to integrate with age, you may need to:

1. Convert PKCS#8 keys to OpenSSH format using `ssh-keygen`
2. Use native age keys for new implementations
3. Implement a conversion layer using libraries like `github.com/youmark/pkcs8`[9]

### Migration Strategy

For your existing Go application, consider this phased migration approach:

**Phase 1: Dual Support**
Implement both your existing PKCS#8 password-based encryption and age encryption, allowing users to choose their preferred method.

**Phase 2: SSH Integration**
If your organization uses SSH keys, add support for SSH-based age encryption using the `agessh` package[6].

**Phase 3: Native Age Keys**
Gradually migrate toward native age X25519 keys for new users while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Performance Considerations

Age is designed for performance and simplicity[1]. The native X25519 implementation provides excellent performance characteristics, while SSH key integration adds minimal overhead. The library is optimized for both small files and large datasets, with around 200 bytes of overhead per recipient plus 16 bytes per 64KiB of plaintext[10].

## Code Integration Examples

### Basic Integration with Existing Password System

```go
// Wrapper to support both PKCS#8 and age encryption
type EncryptionProvider interface {
    Encrypt(dst io.Writer, src io.Reader) error
    Decrypt(dst io.Writer, src io.Reader) error
}

type AgeProvider struct {
    recipients []age.Recipient
    identities []age.Identity
}

func (ap *AgeProvider) Encrypt(dst io.Writer, src io.Reader) error {
    w, err := age.Encrypt(dst, ap.recipients...)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer w.Close()
    
    _, err = io.Copy(w, src)
    return err
}
```

### SSH Key Integration

```go
func LoadSSHIdentity(keyPath string) (age.Identity, error) {
    keyBytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(keyPath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return agessh.ParseIdentity(keyBytes)
}
```

## Advanced Features and Ecosystem

Age's plugin system allows for extensive customization[3]. Popular plugins include:

- **age-plugin-yubikey**: Hardware token support[11]
- **age-plugin-tpm**: TPM 2.0 integration[12]  
- **age-plugin-se**: Apple Secure Enclave support[11]

These plugins can provide additional security layers and integration options for enterprise environments.

## Operational Benefits

Beyond the technical implementation, age provides significant operational advantages:

**Simplified Key Management**: Age keys are short, readable strings that are easy to manage and share[2]. Unlike PGP keys, there are no complex key servers or web of trust to manage.

**No Configuration Complexity**: Age deliberately avoids configuration options, reducing the potential for misconfiguration and security issues[2].

**UNIX Philosophy**: Age works well with existing UNIX tools and can be easily integrated into shell scripts and automation pipelines[2].

**Cross-Platform Support**: The Go implementation ensures consistent behavior across different operating systems and architectures[2].

## Migration and Compatibility Planning

When planning your migration to age-based encryption, consider these compatibility factors:

**File Format Migration**: Age produces binary encrypted files that are not compatible with your current PKCS#8-based system. You'll need to plan for a migration period where both formats are supported.

**Key Distribution**: Age's public key model differs from password-based systems. You'll need to establish processes for distributing and managing public keys.

**Backup and Recovery**: Ensure your backup procedures account for age identity files and have proper key recovery mechanisms in place.

## Security Best Practices

When implementing age encryption in your Go application:

**Key Storage**: Store age identity files securely, preferably encrypted at rest[1]. Never hardcode private keys in your application code.

**Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation procedures, especially for long-term data storage scenarios.

**Multiple Recipients**: Age supports encrypting to multiple recipients, allowing for key rotation and shared access scenarios[1].

**Verification**: Consider implementing additional verification mechanisms since age focuses solely on encryption, not authentication[7].

The age encryption ecosystem provides a modern, secure, and maintainable approach to file encryption that can significantly simplify your current PKCS#8-based system. Whether you choose native age keys, SSH integration, or a hybrid approach, the Go age library offers the flexibility and security needed for production file encryption applications.

The choice between these options largely depends on your existing infrastructure, security requirements, and migration constraints. For new applications, native X25519 keys provide the cleanest implementation. For existing SSH-based infrastructure, the SSH integration path offers an excellent migration strategy while maintaining compatibility with established key management practices.
