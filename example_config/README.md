# Example Configuration

This directory contains example configuration files for ReactorCA. These files serve as reference examples and should not be used directly in your ReactorCA installation.

## Usage

To set up your own configuration, run the following command in your ReactorCA installation:

```bash
ca config init
```

This will create the necessary configuration files in the `config` directory with default values.

## Files

- **ca_config.yaml**: Configuration for your Certificate Authority including identity information, key settings, and password requirements
- **hosts.yaml**: Configuration for host certificates including common names, alternative names, and key settings

## Cryptographic Options

### Key Types

ReactorCA supports the following key types:

1. **RSA**
   - Traditional asymmetric algorithm
   - Specify key size in bits (e.g., 2048, 4096)
   - Example: `algorithm: "RSA", size: 4096`

2. **EC (Elliptic Curve)**
   - More efficient than RSA with smaller key sizes
   - Specify curve name (P256, P384, P521)
   - Example: `algorithm: "EC", size: "P384"`

3. **ED25519**
   - Modern Edwards-curve algorithm
   - Fixed key size (no size parameter needed)
   - Example: `algorithm: "ED25519"`

4. **ED448**
   - Higher security Edwards-curve algorithm
   - Fixed key size (no size parameter needed)
   - Example: `algorithm: "ED448"`

### Hash Algorithms

ReactorCA supports multiple hash algorithms for certificate signatures:

1. **SHA256**
   - Default option, good balance of security and compatibility
   - Example: `hash_algorithm: "SHA256"`

2. **SHA384**
   - Stronger hash, recommended for use with EC P-384
   - Example: `hash_algorithm: "SHA384"`

3. **SHA512**
   - Strongest hash, recommended for high-security certificates
   - Example: `hash_algorithm: "SHA512"`

## Subject Alternative Name (SAN) Types

ReactorCA supports a wide range of SAN types:

1. **DNS Names**
   ```yaml
   dns:
     - "example.com"
     - "www.example.com"
   ```

2. **IP Addresses** (IPv4 and IPv6)
   ```yaml
   ip:
     - "192.168.1.10"
     - "2001:db8::1"
   ```

3. **Email Addresses**
   ```yaml
   email:
     - "admin@example.com"
   ```

4. **URIs**
   ```yaml
   uri:
     - "https://example.com"
   ```

5. **Directory Names** (Distinguished Names)
   ```yaml
   directory_name:
     - "CN=example,O=Example Inc,C=US"
   ```

6. **Registered IDs** (OIDs)
   ```yaml
   registered_id:
     - "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3"
   ```

7. **Other Names** (Custom OIDs with values)
   ```yaml
   other_name:
     - "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3:Custom Value"
   ```

## Compatibility Considerations

- **RSA 2048+ with SHA256** has excellent compatibility with all browsers
- **EC P-256/P-384 with SHA256** works with all modern browsers (5+ years old)
- **ED25519/ED448 and SHA384/SHA512** may have limited compatibility with very old clients
- For maximum compatibility, use RSA 2048 with SHA256
- For future-proofing with good compatibility, use EC P-384 with SHA384
- For highest security, use ED448 with SHA512

## Customization

After running `config init`, you should customize the generated configuration files to match your requirements by editing them in the `config` directory.

## Security Note

The configuration files generated by `config init` should be kept secure as they may contain sensitive information about your PKI infrastructure. The contents of your working `config` directory should never be committed to version control.
